# Geometric-Meltdown
Geometric Meltdown is the successor to a group project, Medical Meltdown. Geometric Meltdown stemmed from Medical Meltdown and was refactored for readability and simplicity. The code is easier to understand, is optimized, and include a plethora of new features. Additionally, Geometric Meltdown now runs on Windows 10. 

This project was built from the ground up and referenced Medical Meltdown to stay in tune with the aesthetic qualities. A lot of the components were reversed engineered as there were various distortions present in the perspective of the original project.
